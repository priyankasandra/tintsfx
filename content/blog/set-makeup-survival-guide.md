# On-Set Makeup Survival Guide

Long shooting days, multiple takes, and challenging conditions—working on set requires more than just good application skills. Here's how to keep your prosthetic work looking flawless from call time to wrap.

## Pre-Shoot Preparation

### Kit Essentials
Always pack these for touch-ups:
- **99% isopropyl alcohol** (edges and cleaning)
- **Matching paint palette** (pre-mixed colors)
- **Stipple sponges** (various textures)
- **Cotton swabs** (precision work)
- **Blotting papers** (oil control)
- **Setting powder** (alcohol-activated)

### Communication is Key
- **Director consultation**: Understand the scene requirements
- **Script breakdown**: Note action sequences, emotional scenes
- **Continuity photos**: Document your work from multiple angles
- **Assistant briefing**: Ensure they know your system

## During the Shoot

### Touch-Up Timing
- **Between setups**: Quick oil blotting and powder
- **Major scene changes**: Full assessment and touch-up
- **After action sequences**: Check for lifting or damage
- **End of day**: Document wear patterns for continuity

### Heat Management
Indian sets get hot. Here's how to cope:

**For the prosthetic**:
- Fan between takes (not during)
- Alcohol spray for cooling (test first)
- Powder strategic areas
- Monitor edge adhesion

**For the actor**:
- Provide cooling towels (away from prosthetic)
- Encourage hydration
- Plan touch-up timing around their comfort

## Emergency Fixes

### Lifting Edges
**Quick fix**:
1. Clean area with alcohol
2. Apply small amount of adhesive
3. Blend edge with stipple sponge
4. Re-color if needed

### Color Fade
**Touch-up technique**:
1. Assess the fade pattern
2. Mix matching color on palette
3. Stipple (don't brush) new color
4. Blend edges seamlessly

### Complete Failure
**When to call cut**:
- Major lifting affecting actor movement
- Visible damage in wide shots
- Actor discomfort affecting performance

**Rapid replacement**:
- Have backup pieces ready
- Know your fastest application technique
- Communicate clearly with AD about time needed

## Actor Comfort

### Physical Comfort
- **Check regularly**: "How does it feel?"
- **Adjust if possible**: Minor modifications without compromising look
- **Plan breaks**: Coordinate with AD for prosthetic breaks

### Psychological Comfort
- **Explain the process**: Actors perform better when they understand
- **Show them the look**: Use mirrors, photos
- **Encourage feedback**: They know their face best

## Working with the Team

### First AD Relationship
- **Be realistic** about touch-up times
- **Communicate problems** early
- **Suggest solutions**, not just problems
- **Respect their schedule** while protecting your work

### Camera Department
- **Discuss lighting** impact on your work
- **Ask about close-ups** in advance
- **Coordinate on color temperature** for makeup matching

## Scene-Specific Challenges

### Action Sequences
- **Pre-stunt check**: Ensure everything is secure
- **Post-stunt assessment**: Document any damage
- **Quick fixes**: Master 30-second touch-ups
- **Backup plans**: Know when to call for replacement

### Emotional Scenes
- **Tear-resistant techniques**: Waterproof where possible
- **Strategic positioning**: Keep tissues away from prosthetics
- **Post-scene care**: Gentle cleaning and touch-up

### Outdoor Shoots
- **Weather protection**: Umbrellas, pop-ups between takes
- **Dust management**: Brush, don't wipe
- **Temperature monitoring**: Watch for heat damage

## End of Day Protocol

### Documentation
- **Continuity photos**: Multiple angles, good lighting
- **Wear notes**: Where did it hold up? Where didn't it?
- **Actor feedback**: How did it feel throughout the day?
- **Time tracking**: Application vs. maintenance time

### Removal Process
- **Gentle technique**: Preserve actor's skin
- **Clean thoroughly**: Remove all adhesive residue
- **Moisturize**: Restore skin after long day
- **Check for irritation**: Address any skin concerns

## Building Your Reputation

### Reliability Factors
- **Consistent quality** throughout long days
- **Problem-solving skills** under pressure
- **Professional communication** with all departments
- **Respect for time** and schedule constraints

### Learning from Each Project
- **Keep detailed notes** about what worked
- **Analyze failures** without making excuses
- **Ask for feedback** from directors and actors
- **Continuously improve** your techniques

## Common Misconceptions

### "Set work is just application"
Wrong. On-set success requires:
- Maintenance skills
- People skills
- Problem-solving
- Stress management

### "Touch-ups slow down production"
Wrong. Professional touch-ups:
- Prevent major delays
- Maintain continuity
- Keep actors comfortable
- Protect the overall look

## Your Professional Growth

Every challenging shoot day teaches you something new. Embrace the pressure, learn from the problems, and remember—the ability to maintain flawless work under stress is what separates professionals from hobbyists.
