# Pros-Aide Transfers: 101

Pros-Aide transfers are the secret weapon for creating seamless, reusable prosthetic effects. Master this technique and you'll have a game-changing skill for both on-set work and personal projects.

## What Are Pros-Aide Transfers?

Pros-Aide transfers are thin, flexible pieces made from Pros-Aide adhesive that can be:
- **Pre-painted** with your desired effect
- **Applied quickly** on set
- **Removed easily** without damage
- **Reused** multiple times

## The Complete Workflow

### 1. Sculpt Your Effect

**Materials needed**:
- Chavant clay or Monster Clay
- Sculpting tools
- Reference images

**Process**:
- Sculpt your wound, scar, or texture
- Keep edges **thin and feathered**
- Smooth surface for clean transfer

### 2. Create the Tray

**Materials**:
- Plaster bandage or ultracal
- Release agent (petroleum jelly)

**Steps**:
1. Apply release agent to sculpture
2. Build plaster negative tray
3. Let cure completely (24 hours)
4. Remove clay, clean tray

### 3. Load the Transfer

**Materials**:
- Pros-Aide adhesive
- Alcohol paints (Skin Illustrator)
- Stipple sponges
- Brushes

**Layering process**:
1. **Base coat**: Thin Pros-Aide layer
2. **Color layer**: Paint your effect
3. **Sealing coat**: Final Pros-Aide layer
4. **Drying**: 24-48 hours depending on humidity

### 4. Application

**Prep**:
- Clean skin with alcohol
- Position transfer
- Apply from center outward

**Blending**:
- Use 99% alcohol to blend edges
- Stipple with makeup sponge
- Color match to surrounding skin

## Pro Tips from the Set

### Storage
- Store between **parchment paper**
- Keep in **cool, dry place**
- Label with creation date

### Reusability
- Clean gently with alcohol
- Don't stretch when removing
- Can use **5-10 times** with care

### Common Mistakes
- **Too thick**: Won't blend seamlessly
- **Rushed drying**: Tacky, difficult to use
- **Poor edge work**: Visible lines on camera

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Layer Effects
Build complex wounds with:
1. Base texture layer
2. Color variation layer  
3. Blood/wetness layer

### Heat Activation
Use hair dryer to:
- Speed drying (carefully)
- Reactivate for repositioning
- Create texture variations

## When to Use Transfers

**Perfect for**:
- Multiple takes of same effect
- Quick actor changes
- Consistent look across scenes
- Tight time constraints

**Avoid for**:
- Single-use effects
- Large coverage areas
- Extreme close-ups (direct application better)

## Cost Breakdown

**Initial investment**: ₹8,000-12,000
- Pros-Aide: ₹3,000
- Paints: ₹4,000
- Tools: ₹2,000
- Tray materials: ₹1,000

**Per transfer**: ₹200-300 in materials
**Time investment**: 3-4 hours total

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Transfer won't adhere:
- Skin not clean enough
- Transfer too old
- Wrong alcohol percentage

### Visible edges:
- Edges too thick in sculpt
- Insufficient blending

### Color mismatch:
- Test on skin before final application
